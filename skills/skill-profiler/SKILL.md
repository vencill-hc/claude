# Skill Profiler

Analyse, profile, and optimise Claude Code skills and agent configurations. Produces structured profiling reports with token savings estimates, model routing recommendations, and context pollution fixes. Can auto-refactor skills with user approval.

## Profiling Modes

| Mode | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Static Analysis** (default) | "profile this skill", "analyse structure" | Structure, tokens, description quality, anti-patterns |
| **Model Routing Audit** | "check model routing", "audit agents" | All of Static + subagent model classification, mismatch detection, delegation pattern audit |
| **Context Pollution Scan** | "reduce context pollution", "check context waste" | All of Static + read-heavy pattern detection, delegation recommendations, cache hygiene audit |
| **Cache Hygiene** | "check caching", "audit cache patterns" | All of Static + cache-busting pattern detection |
| **Delegation Audit** | "check delegation", "audit delegation patterns" | All of Static + agent delegation template compliance |
| **Corpus Overlap** | "find overlap across skills", "redundant skills", "extract common units" | Scans a skills root, clusters overlapping skills, flags collision pairs, proposes extraction targets |
| **Full Profile** | "full profile", "run profiler" | All modes combined, deduplicated, priority-ranked |
| **Auto-Refactor** | "optimise this skill", "auto-refactor" | Full Profile + generates optimised files with user approval |

When the user's intent is ambiguous, default to **Full Profile**.

## Script Location

This skill's Python scripts are in the `scripts/` subdirectory relative to this SKILL.md file. Resolve the absolute path from this file's location. All script invocations below use `<profiler-scripts>` to refer to that directory. This is distinct from `<target-skill-dir>`, which is the skill being profiled.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Intake

Gather the target skill/agent files:

1. If the user provides a path, use it directly
2. If they name a skill, search for it:
   - `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
   - `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
   - Current directory if it contains a SKILL.md
3. If profiling agents, also locate:
   - `~/.claude/agents/` directory
   - `.claude/agents/` directory
4. Confirm the target with the user before proceeding

Ask the user which surface they're targeting if model routing or delegation recommendations are needed:
- **Claude Code**: Full support (subagents, model routing, scripts)
- **Agent SDK**: Full support (programmatic)
- **Claude.ai**: Partial (no subagent model routing or delegation)
- **API**: Full support with manual configuration

### Step 2: Static Analysis

Run the structural analysis script:

```bash
python3 <profiler-scripts>/analyze_structure.py <target-skill-dir>
```

This checks:
- SKILL.md exists with correct casing
- Folder naming (kebab-case)
- No README.md in skill folder
- YAML frontmatter validity (no XML angle brackets)
- Body line count and estimated token count
- References and scripts directory presence
- Inline sections that should be in references/ (troubleshooting >30 lines, examples >20 lines)
- Progressive disclosure compliance

Also run token estimation:

```bash
python3 <profiler-scripts>/estimate_tokens.py <target-skill-dir>
```

And score the description:

```bash
python3 <profiler-scripts>/score_trigger_description.py --description "<description text>"
```

For collision detection, pass other skill descriptions:

```bash
python3 <profiler-scripts>/score_trigger_description.py --description "<desc>" --others "<desc2>" "<desc3>"
```

**Agentic Validation** (rubric sections 2, 3, 5 — see [validation-rubric.md](references/validation-rubric.md)):

After the scripts return, read the target SKILL.md body and the script output, then validate:

- Check anti-pattern findings for false positives (e.g. "always confirm" is a safety requirement, not bad prompting)
- Check for false negatives the regex missed (implicit iteration, unrestricted tool scope, duplicate instructions)
- Assess description effectiveness beyond keyword scoring — do trigger phrases match natural user phrasing? Are negative triggers missing for common false-activation scenarios?
- Check instruction coherence: contradictions, missing error handling, loop risks, implicit assumptions
- Note corrections to feed into the report

### Step 3: Model Routing Audit

**Modes 2, 4, 5 only.** Skip for Static Analysis and Context Pollution modes.

Run the model routing audit:

```bash
python3 <profiler-scripts>/audit_model_routing.py <agents-dir>
```

This classifies each agent by tool permissions and recommends the appropriate model tier:

- **Haiku**: Read-only tools (Read, Grep, Glob), data extraction, test running, log parsing
- **Sonnet**: Code implementation, code review, test generation, multi-file refactoring
- **Opus**: Architecture decisions, complex debugging, strategic planning, security analysis

Also scan the SKILL.md body for operations that imply model needs but happen in the main thread instead of being delegated. Cross-reference with Step 4 findings.

For detailed tier classification, see [model-routing-guide.md](references/model-routing-guide.md).

Also run the delegation patterns audit:

```bash
python3 <profiler-scripts>/audit_delegation_patterns.py <target-skill-dir> [--agents-dir <agents-dir>]
```

This checks agent files against the delegation templates in [delegation-patterns.md](references/delegation-patterns.md):
- Missing maxTurns on agent files
- Missing structured response format guidance
- Overly broad tool sets that don't match any delegation template
- Break-even violations (trivially small delegated tasks)
- maxTurns values mismatched to task complexity

**Agentic Validation** (rubric section 4 — see [validation-rubric.md](references/validation-rubric.md)):

After the scripts return, read each agent's actual instructions (not just frontmatter) and validate:

- Check if tool-based model classification matches the cognitive complexity of the task
- Flag misleading tool presence (e.g. Bash used only for `grep` → Haiku is fine)
- Flag tasks requiring reasoning beyond what tools suggest (read-only tools but architectural analysis needed)
- Validate delegation template matches — does the agent actually follow the template pattern?

### Step 4: Context Pollution Scan

**Modes 3, 4, 5 only.** Skip for Static Analysis and Model Routing modes.

Run the context pollution scanner:

```bash
python3 <profiler-scripts>/scan_context_pollution.py <target-skill-md-path>
```

This detects:
- Sequential file read patterns (>3 consecutive Read/Bash calls)
- Unfiltered MCP tool responses (>1,000 token outputs)
- Test execution in the main thread
- Documentation fetching without subagent delegation
- Log analysis in the main thread

Apply the break-even rule: only recommend delegation when expected tool output exceeds 1,500 tokens or when more than 3 sequential tool calls would occur. Below this threshold, subagent spawn overhead (~500-1,000 tokens) exceeds the savings.

For delegation templates, see [delegation-patterns.md](references/delegation-patterns.md).

Also run the cache hygiene audit:

```bash
python3 <profiler-scripts>/audit_cache_hygiene.py <target-skill-dir>
```

This detects cache-busting patterns from [cache-strategies.md](references/cache-strategies.md):
- Timestamps or dynamic content in system prompts/tool definitions
- Instructions to add/remove MCP tools mid-session
- Dynamic content placed before static content in prompt structure
- Model switching mid-session (invalidates per-model cache)
- Content below minimum cacheable token thresholds

**Agentic Validation** (rubric section 1 — see [validation-rubric.md](references/validation-rubric.md)):

After the scripts return, read the SKILL.md body and validate:

- Look for context pollution the regex missed
- Identify sequential reads without parallelisation that aren't flagged
- Identify large unsummarised tool outputs
- Identify multi-step processing chains where intermediate results inflate context
- Validate cache-busting findings — is the "dynamic content" actually in a system prompt, or is it in a user message where it's fine?

### Step 4.5: Corpus Overlap Scan

**Corpus Overlap and Full Profile modes only.** Skip for all other modes.

Run the corpus overlap scanner against a skills root (defaults to `~/.claude/skills/`):

```bash
python3 <profiler-scripts>/scan_corpus_overlap.py <skills-root>
```

This walks every skill directory containing a SKILL.md and computes:

- **Description Jaccard** — flags collision pairs at >= 22% keyword overlap (advisory; may indicate confusing trigger language)
- **Body Jaccard** on domain-weighted tokens — clusters skills at >= 22% overlap (primary clustering signal)
- **Workflow signature** — shared script names, agent types, tool calls, and platform identifiers (used for evidence and to break ties)

Output is JSON with:
- `clusters` — groups of 2+ skills that share a body pattern, ranked by `avg_body_overlap + avg_workflow_overlap`. Each includes a `shared_signal` (most distinctive shared term), `top_shared_terms`, and an `extraction_candidate` slug.
- `collisions` — pairs whose descriptions overlap above threshold but who are not clustered (likely confusing trigger language, not redundant logic).

**Agentic validation:**

After the script returns, read the SKILL.md body of each clustered skill to confirm the cluster reflects a real shared workflow rather than vocabulary noise. Drop clusters where the shared terms come from incidental phrasing (e.g. multiple skills happening to mention "psql" in passing). Refine the `extraction_candidate` name and scope based on what the bodies actually share. For each surviving cluster, recommend one of:

- **Extract**: pull the shared atomic unit into a `references/<signal>-pattern.md` file the skills cross-reference
- **Merge**: collapse two near-duplicate skills into one
- **Disambiguate**: rewrite descriptions to clarify when each skill applies (for collision pairs)

### Step 5: Generate Recommendations

Aggregate findings from all completed steps, including agentic validation corrections:

1. Deduplicate across modes (e.g., a subagent with `model: inherit` and read-only tools is both a routing and pollution issue)
2. Incorporate agentic validation results — remove false positives, add false negatives
3. Priority-rank by: `(token_savings × frequency) / effort`
4. Estimate savings using the evidence base in [optimisation-catalog.md](references/optimisation-catalog.md)
5. For Claude.ai targets, filter out subagent model routing and delegation recommendations

Each recommendation must include:
- What to change
- Expected token savings
- Effort level (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)
- Which reference file has the detailed technique

Consolidate all agentic validation findings into a single "Agentic Review" section for the report. Present findings as a numbered list with severity, finding, and recommendation — same format as Anti-Patterns. Replace the `## Agentic Review` placeholder in the report with the findings.

### Step 6: Auto-Refactor

**Auto-Refactor mode only.** Skip for all other modes.

Present the full report from Step 5 and ask the user which recommendations to apply. Do NOT auto-apply without explicit confirmation.

For each approved recommendation:

- **Structural**: Rewrite SKILL.md body, extract sections to `references/` files
- **Model routing**: Generate new subagent `.md` files with correct model fields using templates from [delegation-patterns.md](references/delegation-patterns.md)
- **Context delegation**: Generate subagent `.md` files for read-heavy operations
- **Description**: Rewrite description with trigger phrases and negative triggers

Output all generated files for the user to review before writing to disk.

### Step 7: Validation

Generate the final report:

```bash
python3 <profiler-scripts>/generate_report.py <target-skill-dir> [--agents-dir <path>] [--mode full]
```

For Auto-Refactor mode, run the full pipeline again on the optimised version and present a before/after comparison showing:
- Token count changes per tier (L1, L2, L3)
- Model routing improvements
- Context pollution reduction
- Overall efficiency score change

Quality gate for auto-refactored output:
- SKILL.md must remain under 500 lines
- Frontmatter must parse cleanly
- Description must score 7+ on quality
- No new HIGH severity anti-patterns introduced

## Output Format

The profiler produces a structured markdown report. See [report-template.md](assets/report-template.md) for the full template.

Key sections: Summary (score + savings), Structural Analysis (metrics table), Model Routing Audit (agent table), Context Pollution Scan (pattern table), Cache Hygiene Audit (cache-busting findings), Delegation Patterns Audit (agent compliance table), Anti-Patterns Detected (severity-ranked list), Recommendations (impact-ranked table), Agentic Review (consolidated validation findings), Generated Artefacts (if auto-refactor).

## Surface Compatibility

| Feature | Claude Code | Agent SDK | Claude.ai | API |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Structural analysis | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Description tuning | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Progressive disclosure | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Model routing audit | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| Subagent delegation | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| Script execution | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| Auto-refactor | Yes | Yes | Partial | Yes |

Adjust recommendations based on the user's target surface. Never recommend subagent model routing for Claude.ai users.

## Important

- Always show the report before any auto-refactoring
- Never auto-apply changes without explicit user confirmation
- Express all savings and efficiency metrics in tokens, never in dollar amounts
- Conservative model downgrade recommendations only — suggest Haiku only for clear Tier 1 tasks
- When unsure about a model recommendation, suggest Sonnet as the safe default
